# archcrypt
## An alternative to archinstall, that encrypts the installation by default with luks. 

It is a follow up to [archcrypt_py](https://github.com/revellan/archcrypt_py) written in rust with major improvements.

## Installation:
```sh
#Clone the git repo
sudo git clone https://github.com/revellan/archcrypt /opt/archcrypt
cd /opt/archcrypt

#install to /usr/local/bin
sudo make install
```

## Uninstall:
```sh
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/archcrypt
```
